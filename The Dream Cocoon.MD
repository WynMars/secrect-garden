There is a planet far far away from here. On that planet, there is no daytime or night-time; the sky always has the color of the dusk.

On the planet, there are many trees and swamps of different sizes. On those trees, there hang many cocoon-like things. This is the bed of ‘People’. They always sleep inside the cocoon, and wake up at a specific time, get out of the cocoon, climb down the tree, walk to the swamp to get water, and then walk back to the cocoon, continuing to sleep. Their bodies are transparent, as if made of water.

They live their life in their dream, each cocoon is connected to each other by the small tiny string in the dream network, and thus the people inside. People here communicate in their dreams, because the amazement of the dream, their communication is also amazing. However, they cannot control how the dream goes, they cannot do whatever they want in their dream.

When they wake up, they forget everything in the dream, or only remember a small fragment of it; a few minutes later, they will forget all of it, and then enter a new dream.

They die in the dream. When that time comes, they and their cocoons drop down to the floor or to the swamp, decomposing and becoming nutrition. Then the new cocoons will grow on the tree, breeding new life. That's how people keep their life cycle; the population on this planet will never increase or decrease.

At the time, a cocoon drops down, and crashes on another cocoon, the vibration wakes up the person inside the cocoon. Then that person walks out of the cocoon, and take water at the swamp. After he finishes drinking, he is supposed to walk back, but he doesn't; he starts wandering around.

The crash makes him to still remember the dream he had before. He begins to recall that dream, and that dream becomes clearer and clearer. He doesn't want to walk back anymore, otherwise, he will enter the new dream, and forgets this dream, and when he wakes up again, everything will disappear.

He sits down under a tree to take a rest, he shouldn't have done this; he should go back, because his skin cannot bear the air pressure outside for long. He sits under the tree for a long time, the water in his body begins to evaporate, his body becomes weak and flabby. The longer he stays, the more strength he needs to walk back to the cocoon.

He keeps sitting there, he starts to see other creatures that walk out of the cocoon, take water, and then walk back. He remembers they are just like the 'People' in his dream.

Suddenly, he sees a person; that person was in his dream before. In the dream, they had gone on an adventure together, they floated in space, and moved instantly into the deep ocean, and then they ran into a maze, and got lost there. They tried to find each other, and then they got on the roller coaster; when the roller coaster reached the peak, he was disconnected from the dream.

After woke up, he started to worry about that person; sitting on the roller coaster and finding out the person nearby had disappeared, that would be shocking, right? He remembers that he calls that person 'Friend'.

Friend is now drinking water in front of him, and then makes his way back. He begins to fear that Friend will return to the cocoon, so he drags his flabby body, walks to Friend, and grabs Friend's hand by his flabby hand. He can speak in the dream, so he starts to imitate the language in his dream, "Friend, finally we meet each other again." Friend turns back and looks at him, people here don't have eyes, nose and ears, their whole body is just like a transparent plasma filled with water. He sees his reflection on Friend's face, he finds out that he has lost a lot of water. He needs to walk back now, the time remaining is only enough for him to walk back, if not, he will never be back.

Friend's hand was grabbed by him, can't move. He gives a sign to let Friend go with him, but Friend can't even recognize him. He sees that Friend can't recognize him, so he drags Friend under a tree, he is exhausted when he reaches there. Friend wants to go back, but he grabs Friend's hand tightly.

He needs to go back, he will die if he stays a bit longer. But he doesn't want to give up, he wants Friend to wake up. He starts to talk about what happened in their dream, talks for so long, repeats again and again, soon he has lost all his strength, he realizes that he begins to forget some fragments of the dream, he is afraid about forgetting. He grabs Friend's hand, forces Friend to sit down. He then sits down,  uses the other hand to draw scenes of their dream on the ground.

Finally he has finished the drawing, he got no more strength to walk back. He doesn't want to walk back, he finds out that Friend is struggling to get rid of his hand. Now he starts to know how to think; he starts to think that if he keeps grabbing Friend's hand, Friend's body will become like his, he starts to think that once Friend gets back Friend will enter the new dream, he starts to think that he will never return to that dream…he starts to think that he is going to die.

So he lets go of Friend's hand, Friend stands up and then looks at him for a moment. He sees himself in the reflection in Friend's face, he sees that the water inside his body is almost gone, leaves only the skin. He knows that he won't be able to walk back.

The last droplet of water leaves his body. He dies.

Friend walks back to the cocoon, starts the new dream.

He wakes up, forgets about what dream he had before. He walks to the swamp, at that moment, he brushes past him, he keeps walking to the swamp, after his body is filled by water, he walks back to the cocoon, and falls asleep.
